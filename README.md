# 50Projects


This is a single website intended to hold all the projects from this page:
https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/
instead of clogging up my Github with multipe, related, repositories.

Challenges were in essentially creating 50 mini web pages and making so that the user can navigate to any from any.
