# 50Projects


This is a single website intended to hold all the projects from this page:
https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/
instead of clogging up my Github with multipe, related, repositories.

Challenges were in essentially creating 50 mini web pages and making so that the user can navigate to any from any.

For the navbar to work, I decided to do a single nav bar - with the links set absolutely - once the projects were complete, instead of adjusting it after each project, and using the root folder to navigate.

Thsi proved quite laborious, i.e. updating and repeating the navbar, soo I recreated the project using PHP, thinking to maintain the nav bar, and other repeated items as appropriate, in one place.
